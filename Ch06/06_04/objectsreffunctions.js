//check the type of the parameter you're excepting into a function

//when passing in objects into functions, you are passing in a reference to the object in memory rather than a copy of the object
//so any changes made to the object by the function will in fact change the original object 


//this is the difference between entering parameters in functions as a refrence as opposed to as a value
